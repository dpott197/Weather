We have a preliminary screening round where you have to submit a coding challenge. For any reason that you may not be able to do so please let us know.

Below is the problem statement. This exercise should take from 3 to 4 hours to complete and you can complete within 2-3 days at your convenience. Please upload your coding challenge in Github or Gitlab and reply to this email after completion.

Once you get through in Coding challenge, I will review with the team and possibly schedule other Technical Rounds and Behavioral Round of Interviews

Coding Challenge: Weather

Below are the details needed to construct a weather based app where users can look up weather for a city.

Public API

Create a free account at openweathermap.org. Just takes a few minutes. Full documentation for the service below is on their site, be sure to take a few minutes to understand it.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=44.34&lon=10.99&appid={API key}
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=44.34&lon=10.99&appid=78463abf8cee0dd2d06b95c82871d0f5


Built-in geocoding

Please use Geocoder API if you need to automatically convert city names and zip-codes to geo coordinates and the other way around.

Please note that API requests by city name, zip-codes and city id have been deprecated.

Although they are still available for use, bug fixing and updates are no longer available for this functionality.

Built-in API request by city name

You can call by city name or city name, state code and country code. Please note that searching by
states available only for the USA locations.
API call
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name},{country code}&appid={API key}

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name},{state code},{country
code}&appid={API key}

You will also need icons from here:

Requirements
These requirements are rather high-level and vague.

If there are details I have omitted, it is because I will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution.

1. Create a browser or native-app-based application to serve as a basic weather app.

2. Search Screen

a. Allow customers to enter a US city

b. Call the openweathermap.org API and display the information you think a user would be
interested in seeing. Be sure to have the app download and display a weather icon.

c. Have image cache if needed

3. Auto-load the last city searched upon app launch.

4. Ask the User for location access, If the User gives permission to access the location, then
   retrieve weather data by default

In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

What is Important
Proper function – requirements met.

Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds
made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah
blah blah pattern blah blah )).

Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

What is Less Important

UI design – generally, design is handled by a dedicated team in our group.

Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with (for example, if you
aren't comfortable building a single-page app, please don't feel you need to learn how for this).

iOS:

For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, having the Pods included in the
code commits as the source is recommended. (Even though it goes against the CocoaPod's
general rules)

Be sure to use safe area insets

Using Size class wisely for landscape and portrait

Make sure to use UIKit, we would love to see a combination of both UIKit and SwiftUI if you
desire.

Android:

Make sure you are correctly handling any necessary permissions.

Must have technologies as follows

Type Must have

Coding Language Kotlin

(To demonstrate the use of Java, we'd rather you use a combination of Java and Kotlin)

Architecture Pattern MVVM

Network library Retrofit

Unit test Junit

Nice to have technologies as follows

Type Nice to have
Network - Concurrency RxJava, Kotlin Coroutines
Unit test Espresso or Mockito
UI Jetpack Compose
Dependency Injection Dagger 2 or Hilt or Koin
Navigation Jetpack navigation

As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum.

Use all the online resources you can find and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
